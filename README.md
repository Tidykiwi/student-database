# student-database
Simple console CRUD application that manages a student database, completed as part of studying 'BIT504 - Programming 1' at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (BIT = Bachelor of Information Technology)

This application stores student information along with their 
assignment marks. The user will be shown a menu that allows them to add 
students, remove students, and display a report that shows the student grade 
equivalent to their mark.

The application will read a text file ‘studentdata.txt’ containing the data for several 
students. The data will be stored using classes and abstract data types.
The application will display a menu to the user. Based on the user’s input the 
application will perform these functions:
• display student marks
• display student grades
• add new student
• remove student
• exit.

You will be required to convert the numerical marks to a letter grade (such as 96 to 
an A+). This will be required in the markToGrade() method
